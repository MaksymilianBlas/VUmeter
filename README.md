# VUmeter
Project with high hopes but never finished.
This was a project to create a VU meter to show something cool to my little brother. The design is made in KiCad, out of 2 PCBs that connect together via a pin header. The bottom PCB is the control circuitry, and the other one (which is vertical) contains rows of LEDs that should light up according to the loudness of the music, as well as a boost converter module. The control circuit has two main parts, a set of eight comparators that indicate the audio level, and eight simple op-amp constant current drivers that get enabled by the comparator outputs and drive the LEDs via a constant current. This was the main improvement over the similar design found in a video by GreatScott (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyrpx9rEGMI), where the LEDs are supplied from a constant voltage. 
Sadly, two errors have sneaked into the design: Firstly, the logic of the TLV3501 is inverted (it features a Shutdown pin, opposite to the Enable pin of the NCS2002 which was considered at the beginning of the design), and secondly, the comparators are missing pull-up resistors at the outputs (because they are LM393s, which have an open-drain output).
These errors have never been fixed due to lack of time and lost interest. Further possible improvements would be to use dual MOSFETs and quad comparators to save space on the PCB.
